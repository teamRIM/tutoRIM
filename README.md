> ### Prerequisite to install AlgoRIM interface
>
> * Internet connection
> * Administrator rights on the computer
> * Windows operating system (Tested on : Windows 10)
> 

> ### 1. Specify where your data comes from
> 
> * Inscoper: channel 0 is identify with 'c0' in the image name and channel 1 with 'c1'
> * Abbelight: the image name begins with 'ROI2' or 'ROI1', depending on the channel
> * Other (ex: Micromanager...): No prerequisite on the name of the channels but they will not be differentiated.

> ### 2. Input data
> * **'Global folder' mode:** With this mode you can launch several reconstructions by selecting a folder containing several projects. It is based on Inscoper's raw image backup mode: global_folder/sub_folder/images/RAW_DATA/. If you want you launch preview, you need to select precisely the raw data folder you want to launch preview on.
> * **'Raw data folder' mode:** With this mode you can launch reconstruction on one folder containning several .tif files.  
> * **'Only 1 file (Stream)' mode:**  With this mode you can launch reconstruction on one .tif file. You can set the number of raw images per reconstructed image ('Speckles per sequence'). These sequences can be overlaped to improve time resolution and denoising.
