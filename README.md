## Download
Latest version AlgoRIM V1.1 (20/04/21)  
https://github.com/teamRIM/tutoRIM/raw/main/bin/AlgoRIM_V1_1_2_installer.exe

> ### Prerequisite to install AlgoRIM interface
>
> * Internet connection
> * Administrator rights on the computer (In some instances the antivirus try to prevent the installation)
> * Windows operating system (Tested on : Windows 10)

> ### 1. Specify where your data comes from
> 
> * Inscoper: channel 0 is identify with 'c0' in the image name and channel 1 with 'c1'
> * Abbelight: the image name begins with 'ROI2' or 'ROI1', depending on the channel
> * Other (ex: Micromanager...): No prerequisite on the name of the channels but they will not be differentiated.

> ### 2. Input data
> * **'Global folder' mode:** With this mode you can launch several reconstructions by selecting a folder containing several projects. It is based on Inscoper's raw image backup mode: global_folder/sub_folder/images/RAW_DATA/. If you want you launch preview, you need to select precisely the raw data folder you want to launch preview on.
> * **'Raw data folder' mode:** With this mode you can launch reconstruction on one folder containning several .tif files.  
<!---
> * **'Only 1 file (Stream)' mode:**  With this mode you can launch reconstruction on one .tif file. You can set the number of raw images per reconstructed image ('Speckles per sequence'). These sequences can be overlaped to improve time resolution and denoising.--->   

> ### 3. Select folder<!--/file-->

> ### 4. Adjust parameters
> * **PSF emission:** You can determine this PSF experimentally at the emission wavelength.  
> * **PSF excitation:** You can use the free software *'PSF generator'* to generate this PSF at the excitation wavelength. As an alternative you can use the emission PSF.
> * **Image expansion factor:** Physical size of pixels will be divided by this factor.  
> * **PSF expansion factor:** PSF physical size must be the same as for the final image after reconstruction.  
> * **Number of iterations:** You can adjust this setting using preview mode.  
> * **Pre-filtering parameter(Wiener):**  You can adjust this parameter with the adjust button and preview mode.
> * **Regularization parameter:**  

> ### 5. Launch preview
> This mode allows you to preview the reconstruction result on the first raw image. If you want to interrupt it, please use the stop button.  

> ### 6. Launch reconstruction
> This mode starts the reconstruction and saves your results in a folder named according to your settings.
